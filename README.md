Lens Smear Detection Process

The code contains commented variable for reading in the folder path.

Please just type the folder path before the /* .jpg and ensure the entire path is correct.  I faced difficulties with os and path, so this is the easiest way to setup the program to process. If you have png files, you will have to change the extension.

The program uses numpy, cv2, etc.  There are wait periods in the program using the waitKey(0) function.  This waits for the user to hit 'Enter' and moves on through the script.  

The "comparison" visuals, you need to close the window to move to the next one. 

Final image in program will not prompt you, but exit automatically after it displays.

You should be able to save the python file locally in any folder.  Navigate to that folder in terminal.  type python smearOne.py [ENTER] and you should be good to go.
