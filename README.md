# lensSmear_hw_one

Lens Smear Detection Process

The code contains commented variable for reading in the folder path.

Please just type the folder path before the /* .jpg and ensure the entire path is correct.  I faced difficulties with os and path, so this is the easiest way to setup the program to process.

The program uses numpy, cv2, etc.  There are wait periods in the program using the waitKey(0) function.  This waits for the user to hit 'Enter' and moves on through the script.  

You should be able to save the file locally in any folder.  Navigate to that folder in terminal.  type python smear_hw_one.py and you should be good to go.
